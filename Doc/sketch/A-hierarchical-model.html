<h3 class="section">4.3 A hierarchical model</h3>

<p><a name="index-hierarchical-model-475"></a>While <code>sketch</code> was never meant to be a geometric modeling
language, it comes fairly close.  The following example puts all we
have seen to work in a very simple model of the human hand.  Start by
sweeping a line to make a truncated cone, which will be copied over
and over again to make the segments of fingers. 
<a name="index-def-476"></a><a name="index-sweep-477"></a><a name="index-rotate-478"></a><a name="index-line-479"></a>
<pre class="verbatim">
  def O (0,0,0) % origin
  def I [1,0,0] def J [0,1,0] def K [0,0,1] % canonical unit vectors
  def segment {
    def n_faces 8
    sweep { n_faces&lt;>, rotate(360 / n_faces, [J]) } 
      line(proximal_rad, 0)(distal_rad, distal_len)
  }
</pre>
In hand anatomy, <em>distal</em> is &ldquo;at the tip&rdquo; and <em>proximal</em>
is &ldquo;in the area of the palm.&rdquo;  We have omitted all the scalar
constants.  You can find them in <span class="file">hand.sk</span>, which is provided
in the <code>sketch</code> distribution.

   <p>We also need a prototypical sphere to use for the joints themselves. 
<a name="index-def-480"></a><a name="index-sweep-481"></a><a name="index-rotate-482"></a>
<pre class="verbatim">
  def joint_sphere {
    def n_joint_faces 8
    sweep [fillcolor=red] { n_joint_faces, rotate(360 / n_joint_faces, [J]) }
      sweep { n_joint_faces, rotate(180 / n_joint_faces) } 
        (0, -joint_rad)
  }
</pre>

   <p>We'll now design the index finger (number&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->1 in our notational
convention; finger&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->0 is the thumb).  The distal rotation for the
finger applies only to the tip, so we define the following. 
<a name="index-def-483"></a><a name="index-put-484"></a><a name="index-translate-485"></a><a name="index-rotate-486"></a><a name="index-scale-487"></a>
<pre class="verbatim">
  def distal_1 {
    put { translate(joint_gap * joint_rad * [J]) 
          then rotate(distal_1_rot, [I]) 
          then translate((distal_len + joint_gap * joint_rad) * [J]) }
      {segment}
    put { rotate(distal_1_rot / 2, [I])
          then translate((distal_len + joint_gap * joint_rad) * [J]) } 
      {joint_sphere}
    put { scale( [J] + proximal_distal_ratio * ([I]+[K]) ) }
      {segment}
  }  
</pre>
The identifiers here are for size and location constants. The
exception is <code>distal_rot_1</code>.  This rotation parameter models the
flexing of the finger tip.  The first <code>put</code> makes a copy of the
finger segment that is translated upward
<a name="index-translation-transform-488"></a><a name="index-transform_002c-translation-489"></a>just far enough to make room
for the spherical joint.  Then it applies the distal rotation. 
<a name="index-rotation-transform-490"></a><a name="index-transform_002c-rotation-491"></a>Finally it translates the whole assembly upward again to make room for
the middle phlanges (the next bone toward the palm).  The second
<code>put</code> positions the sphere.  There is a rotation to place the
grid on the sphere surface at an nice angle, then a translation to the
base of the distal phlanges, which is also center of its rotation. 
Finally, the last <code>put</code> positions the middle segment itself.

   <p>The middle joint is the next one down, with rotation angle
<code>middle_rot_1</code>.  When this angle changes, we need all the objects
in <code>distal_1</code> to rotate as a unit. 
<a name="index-rotation-transform-492"></a><a name="index-transform_002c-rotation-493"></a>This is the reasoning behind
the next definition.
<pre class="verbatim">
  def finger_1 {
    put { translate(joint_gap * joint_rad * [J])
          then rotate(middle_1_rot, [I])
          then translate((middle_ratio * distal_len + 
                          joint_gap * joint_rad) * [J]) }
      {distal_1}
    put { scale(proximal_distal_ratio)
          then rotate(middle_1_rot / 2, [I])
          then translate((middle_ratio * distal_len + 
                          joint_gap * joint_rad) * [J]) } 
      {joint_sphere}
    put { scale( middle_ratio * [J] + 
                 proximal_distal_ratio^2 * ([I]+[K]) ) }
      {segment}
  }
</pre>
This looks very similar to the previous definition, and it is.  The
important difference is that rather than positioning and rotating a
single segment, we position and rotate the entire &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; defined
as <code>distal_1</code>. 
<a name="index-rotation-transform-494"></a><a name="index-transform_002c-rotation-495"></a>The rest is just arithmetic to compute sizes and
positions that look nice.  The last <code>put</code> places an appropriately
shaped segment that is the <em>proximal phlanges</em>, the bone that
joins the palm of the hand.  This completes the finger itself.

   <p>All the other fingers are described identically to this one.  We
account for the fact that real fingers are different sizes in the next
step, which is to build the entire hand.

   <p>The <code>hand</code> definition that follows includes a section for each
finger.  We'll continue with finger&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->1 and omit all the others. 
(Of note is that the thumb needs slightly special treatment&mdash;an extra
rotation to account for its opposing angle. This is clear in the full
source code.) Not surprisingly, the <code>hand</code> definition looks very
much like the previous two.  It should be no surprise that when the
rotation parameter <code>meta_1_rot</code> changes, the entire finger
rotates! 
<a name="index-rotation-transform-496"></a><a name="index-transform_002c-rotation-497"></a>There is an additional rotation that allows the fingers to spread
laterally.  We say these joints of the proximal phlanges have two
<em>degrees of freedom</em>. The joints higher on the finger have only
one. Finally, each finger is scaled by a factor to lend it proportion.
<pre class="verbatim">
  def hand {
    % finger 1 [all other fingers omitted]
    def scale_1 .85
    put { scale(scale_1) 
          then translate((joint_gap * joint_rad) * [J])
	  then rotate(meta_1_rot, [I])
          then rotate(-spread_rot, [K])
          then translate((proximal_1_loc) - (O)) } 
      {finger_1}
    put { scale(scale_1 * proximal_distal_ratio^2)
          then rotate(meta_1_rot / 2, [I])
          then rotate(-spread_rot, [K])
          then translate((proximal_1_loc) - (O)) } 
      {joint_sphere}

    % palm
    sweep { 1, rotate(6, (0,15,0), [I]) }
      put { rotate(-3, (0,15,0), [I]) } {
        polygon(proximal_1_loc)(proximal_2_loc)
               (proximal_3_loc)(proximal_4_loc)
               (h5)(h6)(h6a)(h9)(h10)
        polygon(h6a)(h7)(h8)(h9)
   }  }
</pre>
The last section of the definition creates the polytope for the palm
of the hand by <code>sweep</code>ing
<a name="index-swept-polygon-498"></a><a name="index-polygon-sweep-499"></a>a 10-sided polygon through a very short
arc (9&nbsp;<!-- /@w -->degrees).  This provides a wedge-shaped profile when viewed
from the side. The thick end of the wedge is the wrist.  Because the
polygon is concave, it is split into into two convex shapes with nine
and four vertices.

   <p>We can now have fun positioning the hand by adjusting the various
rotation angles.  The complete source includes definitions with
alternatives that include the following views and more.
