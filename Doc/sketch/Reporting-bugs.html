<h3 class="section">1.1 Reporting bugs and recommending improvements.</h3>

<p>The group <tt>http://groups.google.com/group/sketch-users</tt>
is the best place to report bugs and make improvements. 
A second method that will probably produce a slower
response is email to <tt>sketch@frontiernet.net</tt>. 
We will try to respond, but can't promise.  In any event, don't be
offended if a reply is not forthcoming.  We're just busy and will get
to your suggestion eventually.

   <p>For bugs, attach a <code>sketch</code> input file that causes the bad
behavior.  Embed comments that explain what to look for in
the behavior of <code>sketch</code> or its output.

   <p>A recommendation for improvement from one unknown person counts as one
vote. We use overall vote tallies to decide what to do next as
resources permit.  We reserve the right to assign any number of votes
to suggestions from people who have been helpful and supportive in the
past.
