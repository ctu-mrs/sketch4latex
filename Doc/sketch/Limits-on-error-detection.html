<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Limits on <code>sketch</code> error detection</h4>

<p><code>Sketch</code> catches many kinds of errors, but not all. For example,
options that sketch does not recognize, even incorrect ones, are
quietly copied to <code>PSTricks</code> commands in the output.  It is also
unfortunately easy to produce <code>sketch</code> inputs that lead to no
picture at all (improper vertex ordering causes everything to be
culled), to pictures that are too big or too small for <code>PSTricks</code>
to draw (due to limits of TeX math), and pictures that look nothing
like what was intended.  A picture with one of these problems can be
difficult to &ldquo;debug.&rdquo;  We offer the following suggestions.
     <ul>
<li>Follow the suggested incremental development method described in
<a href="Overview.html#Overview">Overview</a>. 
<li>Always maintain one or two back-versions of a drawing so that it is
easy to fall back to a known-good increment. 
<li>When using <code>perspective</code>, ensure all finally transformed objects
satisfy z&lt;0 and, in fact, do not come very close to the origin
at all. 
<li>Temporarily use <code>cull=false</code> to see where vertex ordering
problems lie. 
<li>Use temporary changes of color of one or more objects to ensure that
your understanding of the scene geometry is correct. 
<li>If <code>PSTricks</code> complains about something, inspect the output
directly for clues. 
</ul>
